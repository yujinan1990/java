the occasion is I changed the repository in local(create two new directory lesson2/lesson3, and push it successfuly to github, but when I pull it to the Company Computer, It failed.
So I make a new directory lesson4 in github and then try to pull it in local. If I success, that means there must be sth wrong with Com.
If I failed, that means pull can not fetch the new directory and merge it. I works only on files.
And the results is successful. So I am a little confused.
Why in the Company Computor, I can't git pull the new created directory.
wait to resolve the problem.
